// DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES
NOTE:ALL THE DATA TYPES IN DART ARE OBJECTS. THEREFORE ,THIER INITIAL VALUE IS BY DEFAULT NULL.

void main(){
  //NUMBER:INT
  int age =10;
  
  //NUMBER:DOUBLE
  double percentage = 889.99;
  
  //STRING
  String name ="Jasleen kaur";

OUTPUT:

true

// USING THE var DATA TYPE

void main(){
  //NUMBER:INT
  int age =10;
  var score =99; // it is inferred as integer by the compiler
  //NUMBER:DOUBLE
  double percentage = 889.99;
  var marks= 33.33; //it is inferred as double by the compiler
  
  //STRING
  String name ="Jasleen kaur";

  print(score);
  print(marks);

OUTPUT:
99

google
false

THIER INITIAL VALUE IS BY DEFAULT NULL...
like..

void main(){
int age;
print(age);
}

output:
null

but now it is must to assign the value otherwise it gives error like this ...

compileNewDDC
main.dart:18:9: Error: Non-nullable variable 'age' must be assigned before it can be used.
  print(age);
